The FigureSkatingCompetitionManager (FSCM) is a software that will be used for swedish (and any other country using the same system) figure skating clubs when they arrange star competitions. The software will import all skaters that signed up for the competition from an xml file that is generated by another tool called IndTa. The xml file contains all the data about the competition, the name of it, date, what skaters that singed up and what skating classes they have.

The fscm sofware will create start order, warm-up groups and the schedule that shows which skaters that competes at what time. The software is also used for playing the music during the actual skating and the judges will also insert the results into the software.
